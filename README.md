# PIXI.js Bootstrap

This is a little bootstrap repository I created for Ludum Dare, feel free to fork it and use it
as a basis for your game. This includes:

* PIXI.js
* Stats.js (FPS Counter)
* Webpack + Webpack Dev Server (Automatically reloads on file change)
* Babel + ES6 Preset
* A simple game / screen structure with a preloader mechanism
* A sample `sprites.tps` file for use with TexturePacker

Have fun!

## Installation

* Fork this repository and clone your forked repository
* Inside the repository, run either `npm install` or (if you're a cool kid and you use yarn instead
  of npm) just run `yarn`
* After installation has finished, run `npm start` and you're good to go.
